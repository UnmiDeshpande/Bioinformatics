# Bioinformatics Learning Repository 🧬💻

Welcome to my Bioinformatics repository! This repo contains solutions to classical bioinformatics problems, coding exercises, and computational biology projects, primarily from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/). It serves as a record of my journey applying programming to molecular biology and genetics.

#🚀 About Me

I am a molecular biologist passionate about integrating computational methods with experimental biology. This repository reflects my growing expertise in:

- DNA/RNA sequence analysis  
- Protein translation and codon manipulation  
- Pattern matching and motif discovery  
- Population genetics and combinatorial modeling  
- Python programming for biological datasets  

---

Each script is designed to be self-contained, takes input directly or via files, and prints outputs in a format suitable for problem-solving platforms like Rosalind.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Python – Core programming language  
- Git & GitHub – Version control and code sharing
